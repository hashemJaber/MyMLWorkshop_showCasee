## Overview
### Description
The app helps organize machine learning projects such as organzinig images and assining them to a project and giving them a value, also the app will provide a user interface to design neural networks for all kinds of applicaitons and have the code sent to their email once done, without the needed wiegths and biases necessarly 



### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Utilities and Developer Tools
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile 
- **Story:** The user will be able to organize machine learning projects, add data, and design neural networks in the programing language they want 
- **Market:** Companies, Students, and individuals interested in machine learning would be able to use it as in groups or individually depending on each organization and personal preference. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used often by developers, depending on what tools/utilities the user is looking for.
- **Scope:** Large potential for use with machine learning, projects to share with clients, or other group project planning. It is also has a large potential for people who want to learn and see different developer tools and utilities.

## Product Spec

### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**

* User can create a new account
* signup page
* Projects page feed
* Projects assets page
* Projects Nueral Networks page 
* Projects Nueral Network page
* Projects Output Schema Design 

**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**

* projects that are published are blurred unless a user posts a new project, then the blurr goes away.
* Top developer tools and utilities that is recommended for users. 
* User can add a comment to a project
* User can see trending projects

### 2. Screen Archetypes

* Login
* Register - User logs into their account
   * Upon Download/Reopening of the application, the user is prompted to log in or signup to gain access to the project feed page, if user has an account already they can choose the login option. 
* Signup 
* Register - User logs into their account
   * Upon Download/Reopening of the application, the user is prompted to either login or sign up page where the user can create an account if chosen to signup to be able to access the project feed page.
* Project feed page
    * Upon signing in or loging in the user can see a page of projects or create a new project option.
* New project page
    * The user has two options where a user can have a user assets options and a neural networks option.
* Assets screen
    * organzinig images and assining them to a project and giving them a value
* neural networks screen
    * design neural networks for all kinds of applicaitons and the user can choose whatever they want added on their project
